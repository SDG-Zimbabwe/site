## Data StoryTelling: Data for Development
The primary organization in Zimbabwe that generates official statistics, the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT), is in charge of gathering and disseminating data to monitor Zimbabwe's progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Together with stakeholders and other statisticians, ZIMSTAT is examining novel approaches and technologies that could be applied to close the gaps in SDG data.

## [National Strategy for the Development of Statistics II(NSDS2)](https://www.zimstat.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/nss/2023/Zimbabwe NSDS2_SIGNED_COPY.pdf)

The Government of Zimbabwe has committed itself to implementing all the 17 SDGs as it considers them important for the country and will prioritise ten SDGs out of the agreed seventeen goals. This commitment and prioritisation implies that there will be a greater demand for data from the National Statistical System for benchmarking and tracking progress in these goals. The NSDS will therefore seek to improve the availability of these data through strengthening administrative data systems, surveys and census to address the needs of the Government.
